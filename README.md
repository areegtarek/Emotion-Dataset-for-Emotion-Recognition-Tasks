A dataset of English Twitter messages with six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise. For more detailed information please refer to the paper below.

The data has already been preprocessed based on the approach described in their paper.

            "label": 0,
            "text": "im feeling quite sad and sorry for myself but ill snap out of it soon"
          }
